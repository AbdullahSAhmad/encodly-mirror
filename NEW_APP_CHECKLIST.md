  - [ ] deploy:app-name (if applicable)
- [ ] Add to build:apps and deploy scripts
- [ ] Add to main dev script for parallel running

### 7. **Startup Scripts**
- [ ] Add app to `start-all-apps-wt.bat` with correct port
- [ ] Update any other startup scripts in the project

### 8. **Build and Deploy Configuration**  
- [ ] Verify app builds successfully with `npm run build:app-name`
- [ ] Test dev server with `npm run dev:app-name`
- [ ] Ensure app works with shared packages

### 9. **SEO and Analytics**
- [ ] Verify SEO component is properly configured
- [ ] Ensure Google Analytics is integrated via shared-analytics

- [ ] Test info modal content and styling
- [ ] Verify app appears correctly on main homepage
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile/tablet
- [ ] Verify all links and buttons work correctly

### 11. **Documentation**
- [ ] Add app to any relevant documentation
- [ ] Update README if app adds new dependencies
- [ ] Document any special setup requirements

## üöÄ After Integration

### Rebuild Shared Packages
```bash
npm run build:shared
```

### Test All Integration Points
- [ ] Header dropdown shows new app
- [ ] Command palette finds app in search
- [ ] Main homepage displays app card
- [ ] Info modal opens and displays correctly
- [ ] All navigation works across apps

### Deployment Verification
- [ ] Verify subdomain is configured
- [ ] Test production URLs work
- [ ] Confirm app loads in production environment

## üìù Example Integration

For reference, see how JWT Encoder was integrated:
- URLs: Added `jwtEncoder: 'http://localhost:5006'` and production URL
- Header: Added `{ name: 'JWT Token Encoder', href: toolUrls.jwtEncoder, description: 'Create & sign JWT tokens' }`
- Command Palette: Added with keywords `['jwt', 'token', 'encode', 'create', 'sign', 'json', 'web', 'generate']`
- Homepage: Added with features `['Token creation', 'Custom payloads', 'HMAC signing', 'Payload templates']`
- Info Modal: Comprehensive content about JWT encoding, algorithms, and security

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Forgetting to rebuild shared packages** - Changes won't take effect
2. **Inconsistent naming** - Use the same app name across all integration points
3. **Missing keywords** - Command palette won't find the app
4. **Wrong URLs** - App won't be accessible from navigation
5. **Outdated build scripts** - App won't build in CI/CD
6. **Missing analytics** - Can't track app usage
7. **Broken info modal** - Poor user experience

## üîß Automation Ideas for Future

Consider creating scripts to automate:
- Adding new apps to all configuration files
- Generating boilerplate integration code
- Validating all integration points are complete
